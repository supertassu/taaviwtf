Looks like <a href=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Code-in/2019#Wrap-up_blog_posts>other people</a> are starting to blog about so here&rsquo;s my blog post so I do not look like a weird antisocial hermit. To be honest, I had a lot of fun participating.</p><p>In the end, I completed 31 tasks and had done little under 4.5% of all completed <a href=https://wikimedia.org>Wikimedia</a> tasks.</p><p><img src=/img/gci-completed-tasks.png alt="31 completed tasks">
<span class="text-sm text-gray-500">such a taboo talking about task counts</span></p><p>All of the tasks I did were in Wikimedia. I&rsquo;ve contributed some small patches there before, and I have about <a href=https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec/en.wikipedia.org/Majavah>2,000 edits</a> in the English Wikipedia, so I wasn&rsquo;t a newcomer to the environment.</p><p>My first task was &ldquo;<a href=https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/5392401758158848/>Convert two plain text files in MediaWiki core in /doc to Markdown format (III)</a>&rdquo;. It was a fairly simple task, but it was my <a href=https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/mediawiki/core/+/554261/>first patch</a> to the MediaWiki core.</p><p>When I claimed my second task, &ldquo;<a href=https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6133879677648896/>Add a namespace filter</a>&rdquo;, I a message in IRC from <a href=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Martin_Urbanec>Martin</a>, who I had worked with before (they are a <a href=https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/SWAT>SWAT deployer</a>) asking if I was really this young.
Martin also mentored multiple tasks that I completed, so thanks for those.</p><p>For the first ~2 weeks, I had completed at least one task every day. Unfortunately then there were some school stuff that required my attention and my streak was cut short.
After the streak, I did not do any tasks for about some time due to IRL stuff (school, etc) and lack of motivation. After sometime the new years I returned to work.</p><p>I claimed my last task (<a href=https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/4808316513943552/>[Tracker] Create maintenance script to force re-queueing MediaWiki communication methods for specified list of tickets</a>) about two hours before task claiming was closed.</p><p>I personally feel that there weren&rsquo;t enough tasks in MW Core or extensions as they are the most interesting projects on
(excluding the <a href=https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6747800197398528/>jsonlint</a> <a href=https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/5717089717846016/>or</a> <a href=https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/4646299207467008/>jshint</a> <a href=https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/5001623999348736/>to</a> <a href=https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6293757419323392/>eslint</a> converting tasks and extension manifest schema upgrading tasks), most actual coding tasks were on Toolforge tools. I ended working with Python most as it&rsquo;s really common on Toolforge for some reason.</p><p>I want to thank <a href=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Florianschmidtwelzow>Florian</a> for making the notable expections and mentoring a couple of tasks for Core
(<a href=https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6713578032201728/>Create tests for UploadFromUrl::isAllowedHost</a>) and for the Translate extension
(<a href=https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6387459487694848/>GettextFFS should implement isContentEqual</a>).</p><p>GCI was definitely a great experience. The mentors knew what they were doing and I had a ton of fun. I am definitely looking for being a part of it in some form next year. Thanks to everyone who was involved this year!</p><p><a href=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Code-in/2019#Wrap-up_blog_posts>Other people</a> have also written about this years GCI.
