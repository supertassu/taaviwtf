Many other humans have a page on their website that show what hardware and software they use. This is my version of said page.

## Hardware

* My PC is built from a Lenovo S30 with a Xeon E5-4560L CPU and 32 gigs of RAM. I slapped a GTX 1660 Ti and couple of SSDs inside it. It's a great budget PC for gaming and software development.

  Foo bar
* I use three monitors with my PC: an Asus VP28UQG (28" 4k 60Hz), a Samsung C27JG50 (27" 1440p 144Hz) and a cheap Asus 24" (FullHD, 60Hz). All three of them were bought when they were on sale or on found from my local hardware store's discount bin.
* To hold the monitors, I have a Mozi quad display stand. I have the Asus monitors stacked on top of each other and the Samsung one vertically right next to them.
* The hardware I use in my lab with my network/servers/etc is described [here]({{< ref "lab/0x00-overview" >}}).
* My laptop is an Asus 14" ZenBook 3 Deluxe UX490UA. It has an  14" screen, i7, 16 gigs of RAM and an 512 gig SSD. It's a great laptop.
