I use my lab to experiement or play around with stuff that I can't do elsewhere, for example enterprise networking and servers and all that kind of stuff.
I am a teenager so I don't haver a real production environment that I can play around with. I also host services that I don't 

This article will work as a directory for all articles related to my lab.

I expect that at least the following parts will exist at some point:

* [[0x01]]({{< ref "0x01-network.md" >}}) Network setup overview (routing, VLANs, etc)
* Hypervisor setup and basic service overview
* Detailed posts for some advanced services, such as
  * Puppet
  * Windows AD
  * Home Assistant
* Possibly something about my NAS? It's just a boring FreeNAS install in an old computer.
