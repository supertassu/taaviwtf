> For those who also participated, my nickname was 'tassu' in irc, 'Majavah' [on-wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Majavah) and on [Phabricator](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/Majavah) and 'taavi' on GCI website. Sorry for the confusion!

I participated in [Google Code-In](https://codein.withgoogle.com) for the first time this winter. Looks like [other people](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Code-in/2019#Wrap-up_blog_posts) are starting to blog about so here's my blog post so I do not look like a weird antisocial hermit. To be honest, I had a lot of fun participating.

In the end, I completed 31 tasks. For some reason, the amount of total tasks done is not visible anymore (it was during the context), but in the last minutes I had done little under 5% of all completed [Wikimedia](https://wikimedia.org) tasks.

{{< small "such a taboo talking about task counts" >}}

All of the tasks I did were in Wikimedia. I've contributed some small patches there before, and I have about [2,000 edits](https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec/en.wikipedia.org/Majavah) in the English Wikipedia, so I wasn't a newcomer to the environment.

My first task was "[Convert two plain text files in MediaWiki core in /doc to Markdown format (III)](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/5392401758158848/)". It was a fairly simple task, but it was my [first patch](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/mediawiki/core/+/554261/) to the MediaWiki core.

When I claimed my second task, "[Add a namespace filter](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6133879677648896/)", I a message in IRC from [Martin](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Martin_Urbanec), who I had worked with before (they are a [SWAT deployer](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/SWAT)) asking if I was really this young.
Martin also mentored multiple tasks that I completed, so thanks for those.

For the first ~2 weeks, I had completed at least one task every day. Unfortunately then there were some school stuff that required my attention and my streak was cut short. 
After the streak, I did not do any tasks for about some time due to IRL stuff (school, etc) and lack of motivation. After sometime the new years I returned to work.

I claimed my last task ([[Tracker] Create maintenance script to force re-queueing MediaWiki communication methods for specified list of tickets](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/4808316513943552/)) about two hours before task claiming was closed.

I personally feel that there weren't enough tasks in MW Core or extensions as they are the most interesting projects on
(excluding the [jsonlint](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6747800197398528/) [or](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/5717089717846016/) [jshint](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/4646299207467008/) [to](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/5001623999348736/) [eslint](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6293757419323392/) converting tasks and extension manifest schema upgrading tasks), most actual coding tasks were on Toolforge tools. I ended working with Python most as it's really common on Toolforge for some reason.

I want to thank [Florian](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Florianschmidtwelzow) for making the notable expections and mentoring a couple of tasks for Core
([Create tests for UploadFromUrl::isAllowedHost](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6713578032201728/)) and for the Translate extension
([GettextFFS should implement isContentEqual](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6387459487694848/)).

GCI was definitely a great experience. The mentors knew what they were doing and I had a ton of fun. I am definitely looking for being a part of it in some form next year. Thanks to everyone who was involved this year!

[Other people](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Code-in/2019#Wrap-up_blog_posts) have also written about this years GCI. Check them out after reading my one.
