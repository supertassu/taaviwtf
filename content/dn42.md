I am connected to the [dn42](https://dn42.dev) network.

## AS details

My primary ASN is [AS4242423270](https://explorer.burble.com/#/aut-num/AS4242423270), named AS-TAAVI.

## IP space

My internal dn42 network is available on both IP versions.

* TAAVI-NET-V4-1: `172.22.130.128/27`
* TAAVI-NET-V6-1: `fd96:70f6:b174::/48`

## Domains and DNS

> dns is still in planning!

In addition to reverse DNS for my IP space, I control the following domains:

* `taavi.dn42`
* `taavi-dns.dn42`
* `as4242423270.dn42`

Currently the authoritative name servers for all zones are:

* `ns01.taavi-dns.dn42` (TODO: IP address)

I do not offer public recursive name servers at the moment.

## Sites

### uc-fi-hel1

This is hosted on UpCloud's FI-HEL1 cluster. All machines should be available with both IP versions.

## Peering

I'm fairly new to dn42 by myself. I'm not saying that you should not peer with me in any case, but I'm saying that you probably want to have other peers in case I have some issues.

If you want to peer with AS4242423270 under the [Pico peering agreement](https://picopeer.net/), please see below on my contact details.

## Technical details

My infrastructure is based on Debian GNU/Linux and configured using [a set of](https://git.majava.org/dn42/ansible) Ansible playbooks.
