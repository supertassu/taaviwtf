I am connected to the [dn42](https://dn42.dev) network.

## AS details

My primary ASN is [AS4242423270](https://explorer.burble.com/#/aut-num/AS4242423270), named AS-TAAVI.

## IP space

My internal dn42 network is available on both IP versions.

* TAAVI-NET-V4-1: `172.22.130.128/27`
* TAAVI-NET-V6-1: `fd96:70f6:b174::/48`

## Domains and DNS

In addition to reverse DNS for my IP space, I control the following domains:

* `taavi.dn42`
* `taavi-dns.dn42`
* `as4242423270.dn42`

Currently the authoritative name servers for all zones are:

* `ns01.taavi-dns.dn42` (TODO: IP address)

I do not offer public recursive name servers at the moment.

## Sites

### uc-fi-hel1

This is hosted on UpCloud's FI-HEL1 cluster. All machines should be available with both IP versions.
