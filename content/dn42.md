I am connected to the [dn42](https://dn42.dev) network.

## AS and BGP

My primary ASN is [AS4242423270](https://explorer.burble.com/#/aut-num/AS4242423270). I use bird2 for BGP.

## IP space

My internal dn42 network is available on both IP versions.

* TAAVI-NET-V4-1: `172.22.130.128/27`
* TAAVI-NET-V6-1: `fd96:70f6:b174::/48`

## Domains and DNS

In addition to reverse DNS for my IP space, I control the following domains:

* `taavi.dn42`
* `as4242423270.dn42`

The authoritative name server for all zones is `ns01.taavi.dn42` which is running bird9. I'm hoping to get a second server up and running at some point. I do not offer public recursive name servers at the moment.

## Peering

I'm fairly new to dn42 by myself. Unless you have a particularly good reason, you probably don't want to peer with me.
If you do want to peer with AS4242423270 under the [Pico peering agreement](https://picopeer.net/) for some reason, please see below on my contact details.

Note that AS4242423270 does not provide connectivity to or via certain parts of the 10/8 range used by ChaosVPN due to conflicts with internal addressing.

## Technical details

My infrastructure is based on Debian GNU/Linux and configured using [a set of](https://git.majava.org/dn42/ansible) Ansible playbooks.
