I am connected to the [dn42](https://dn42.dev) network, which is basically a playground for BGP and other large-scale networking techniques.

## Network

My primary ASN is [AS4242423270](https://explorer.burble.com/#/aut-num/AS4242423270). My IP space is:

* TAAVI-NET-V4-1: `172.22.130.128/27`
* TAAVI-NET-V6-1: `fd96:70f6:b174::/48`

### Home network

I have a separate ASN, [AS4242423271](https://explorer.burble.com/#/aut-num/AS4242423271),
for my home network for [various reasons](https://git.dn42.com/dn42/registry/pulls/683).
The IP space for my home network is:

* TAAVI-HOME-NET-V4-1: `172.22.131.128/28`
* TAAVI-HOME-NET-V6-1: `fdf4:e251:75d9::/48` 

This network does NOT have an open peering policy.

## Domains and DNS

In addition to reverse DNS for my IP space, I control the following domains:

* `taavi.dn42`
* `as4242423270.dn42`

## Sites

Details for individual sites and nodes are located below, if I've told you
something else use that instead of what this page says.

### Peering

Feel free to get in touch if you want to peer with me. Note that my network does
not provide connectivity to or via certain parts of the 10/8 range due to
conflicts with internal addressing.
