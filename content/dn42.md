I am connected to the [dn42](https://dn42.dev) network, which is basically a playground for BGP and other large-scale networking techniques.

These details can also be found on **[noc.taavi.dn42](https://noc.taavi.dn42)**.

My primary ASN is [AS4242423270](https://explorer.burble.com/#/aut-num/AS4242423270). My IP space is:

* TAAVI-NET-V4-1: `172.22.130.128/27`
* TAAVI-NET-V6-1: `fd96:70f6:b174::/48`

This network is open for peering, see details below.

PGP key is available from [https://taavi.wtf/pgp.txt](https://taavi.wtf/pgp.txt)
and from some keyservers, such as [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/3465469CB19D61E5E2EA8AFBEF242F709F912FBE).

### Peering

Feel free to get in touch if you want to peer with me and have a node nearby.
Note that my network does not provide connectivity to or via certain parts of
the 10.0.0.0/8 range due to conflicts with internal addressing.

Multiprotocol BGP over WireGuard and  IPv6 link local is preferred, if you need
something else let me know and we can figure something out.

## Home network

I have a separate ASN, [AS4242423271](https://explorer.burble.com/#/aut-num/AS4242423271),
for my home network. The IP space for my home network is:

* TAAVI-HOME-NET-V4-1: `172.22.131.128/28`
* TAAVI-HOME-NET-V6-1: `fdf4:e251:75d9::/48` 

This network does NOT have an open peering policy.
