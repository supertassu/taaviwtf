# Taavi Väänänen

Hi! My name is **Taavi** (he/him), I am a Finnish high school student.
My main projects are [Toolforge](https://toolforge.org) and
[MediaWiki](https://mediawiki.org), although I try to contribute to other
free software projects if I get the opportunity.

## Contact me

The best way to talk to me is via IRC, I'm `majavah` on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/).

You can also e-mail me, unless I've told you to use some other address (I have
way too many) feel free to use <a href="mailto:hi@taavi.wtf" rel="me">hi@taavi.wtf</a>.
If you use PGP, my key is `3465 469C B19D 61E5 E2EA 8AFB EF24 2F70 9F91 2FBE`, which
is available from <a href="https://taavi.wtf/pgp.txt" rel="pgpkey authn">taavi.wtf/pgp.txt</a>
and common keyservers such as [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/3465469CB19D61E5E2EA8AFBEF242F709F912FBE).

I'm also <a href="https://mastodon.technology/@taavi" rel="me">@taavi@mastodon.technology</a>
on Mastodon (but I toot fairly infrequently).

Most of my new programming projects are on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~taavi/" rel="me">sr.ht</a>,
some older projects are still on [GitHub](https://github.com/supertassu/).

## Colophon

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and styled with
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). It features a
[custom build](https://static.taavi.wtf/fonts/Iosevka/config.toml.txt) of the
[Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka) font. The source code is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/supertassu/taaviwtf) (at least for now) and the site
itself is hosted on GitHub Pages (no IPv6 support, boo!).

It uses zero JavaScript and just a couple of kilobytes of CSS styles.
Most of the page size currently comes to the custom font, which takes
about 25kb to fully load, even with most unnecessary characters
[removed](https://dev.to/platformos/optimizing-font-files-for-modern-web-3jm8).
